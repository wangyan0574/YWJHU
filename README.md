# Decision Analytics Foundamentals Project: Investigation on Pet Supply Industry Insight

#Business Insights (Pet supply)

The purpose of this research project is to understand the pet supply industry, more specifically, helping my family business to find a way enter the US pet supply market in a comfortable, profitable way. The findings show that it is best to target millennials as the main customer demographic, focus product ideas specifically into cats and dogs, and finally in terms of market channel, about 70%  in partnership with pet retail chain stores and 30% of the effort on e-commerce directly connect to end users.

These are the questions that I want to investigate

1. what do pet owners buy most often
2. The demographics: the people buys pet products might be very different people. Millennials might buy higher priced product simply because they likes higher quality and better asthetics; whereas older generation may prefer anythings with good quality and just works.
3. How do I connect to that desired market? Wholesale to distribute stores or direct retail (e-commerce, amazon)

Datasets:
business/industry datasets: library jhu. Pet shelters trends (trends over years)
- currently the data are sourced from [Simply Analytics](https://app-simplyanalytics-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/)
- [Statista](https://www-statista-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/)

Overall goal:
1. Get insights of the pet industry
2. The shopping trends of different demographics: find profitability of different demographics (this will help to determine which target customer group will be a better choice when first entering the market in US!)

BELOW ARE THE THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. it would be interesting to research pet spread in all US households, proof of Cats and Dogs are the dominant pet category to do business in:

2. We can also look at the "2019 pet supply expenditure by state" vs "Number of pet supply stores" on a map basis, the colors represent the amount spent (either as houseHold average or stateSUM)
On average / household: this shows where the quality buyers are since they tend to spend more

State SUM: this shows where the big markets are
