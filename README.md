# Decision Analytics Foundamentals Project: Investigation on Baltimore environmental improvements using data analytics

#Business Insights (Pet supply)

These are the questions that I want to investigate

1. what do pet owners buy most often (2018,2019)
2. which product is the most profitabble ()
3. The demographics: the people buys pet products might be very different people. Millennials might buy higher priced product simply because they likes higher quality and better asthetics; whereas older generation may prefer anythings with good quality and just works.
4. Trends the pet industry are going, what kind of new, niche products are coming up.

Datasets:
business/industry datasets: library jhu. Pet shelters trends (trends over years)
- currently the data are sourced from [Simply Analytics](https://app-simplyanalytics-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/)

Overall goal:
1. Get insights of the pet industry
2. The shopping trends of different demographics: find profitability of different demographics (this will help to determine which target customer group will be a better choice when first entering the market in US!)

BELOW ARE THE THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. it would be interesting to research pet spread in all US households, proof of Cats and Dogs are the dominant pet category to do business in:
