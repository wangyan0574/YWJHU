# Decision Analytics Foundamentals Project: Investigation on Pet Supply Industry Insight

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The purpose of this research project is to understand the pet supply industry, more specifically, helping my family business to find a way enter the US pet supply market in a comfortable, profitable way. 
- Challange: finding a good dataset that include many pet owners with their demographic, purchasing trends and purchasing channels is almost impossible. Everything about the pet industry insights during this research has to be made step by step using multiple datasets.
- The findings show that it is best to target millennials as the main customer demographic, focus product ideas specifically into cats and dogs, and finally in terms of market channel, about 70%  in partnership with pet retail chain stores and 30% of the effort on e-commerce directly connect to end users.
- Some suggestion would be to purchase the annual article of APPA(American Pet Products Association) National Pet Owners Survey, if the company can afford the steep price in the future, which can be a great dataset to work with.


# INDUSTRY:
- Pet Supply Industry
- To me, it is important because it can help my family's business to find a better way enter the US market. To the readers, especially pet owners, we can also use this research to see who are the big chain stores of pet supplies and thus may have better pricing for supply purchases.

# DATA QUESTIONS
My data questions are as follows
1. what do pet owners buy most often
2. The demographics: the people buys pet products might be very different people. Millennials might buy higher priced product simply because they likes higher quality and better asthetics; whereas older generation may prefer anythings with good quality and just works.
3. How do I connect to that desired market? Wholesale to distribute stores or direct retail (e-commerce, amazon)

Here is how I obtain my answers:
- First, I need to know which pets are the most popular among US households. Then find which products are bought the most often for those pets. Next is to see which demographic I am suggesting to focus. Once that's figured, I need to determine the best strategy to connect to users (either through traditional retail chain store partnership or direct sale on Amazon). All these dataset came from [Statista](https://www-statista-com.proxy1.library.jhu.edu/), as it is free for Hopkins students and is a great source of industry data. However, those are still separate datasets and not specific down to a user level but only at a demographic level. I'd wish to obtain a huge survey dataset with more specific data.
- The percentages are important in determine the dominating pet category, the pet supply product, which chain store to partner with.
- The datasets I used are all consolidated into one file and uploaded.

# DATA ANSWERS
- The results are straight forward, dogs and cats are the dominating Pet category. The millennials should be the company focus when designing the product styles and tweaks towards their taste. Possible channel to distribute products to consumer are through big pet chain stores (such as, petco, petvalue), about 70 % of the sales should be focused here, and another 30% should focus on direct sale on e-commerce websites such as Amazon.
- I found Pie charts, are really helpful in detemine the dominances. Bar charts can be a great tool to show trends (a huge increase in online shopping for pet supplies), while line charts can be helpful in comparing two trends (online vs store purchase of pet supplies over the years.)
