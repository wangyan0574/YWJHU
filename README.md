# Decision Analytics Foundamentals Project: Investigation on Baltimore environmental improvements using data analytics

#Environment

These are the questions that I want to investigate

1. How areas of Baltimoreâ€™s environment can be improved? (Air, water?)
2. What is the most dangerous/ negative environmental impact that the city of Baltimore is current creating? (Factories? Air pollution?)
3. How are these environmental impacts relating to citizens?

#Taking question on buying habits of pet owners can be interesting

1. what do pet owners buy most often
2. which product is the most profitabble
3. The demographics
